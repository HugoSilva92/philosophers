# Grade 100/125

It was the introduction to Threads.

By far (at least for now), my favorite project.

At this point, I only saw the code running in "cascade". When the threads began, seeing the code going to the handler and doing their code, was awsome!

The bonus is working, but I'm getting too many leaks to see where I'm failling.

I've tryied it for 7 days to fixed, even asked my peers for some help, but with no chances.

So I've given up to it, maybe in the future as this project was great!

Subject of the project included on repository.
